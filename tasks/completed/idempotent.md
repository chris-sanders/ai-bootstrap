# Task: Idempotent bootstrap
**Status**: completed
**Started**: 2025-04-08
**Completed**: 2025-04-08

## Objective
The bootstrap script should avoid damaging any existing files. Running the script shouldn't change existing files unless a force flag is provided.

## Context
The initial implementation re-running bootstrap will overwrite current files possibly causing the user loss of data.

## Success Criteria
- [x] The bootstrap script generates the expected files for an empty directory same as it does today
- [x] Modifying files and re-running the bootstrap will not change existing files
- [x] Removing files and re-running bootstrap will replace the missing files
- [x] Running bootstrap with a force flag will overwrite existing files replacing their contents

## Dependencies
None

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the bootstrap script with a flag to force
2. Check each file before creation and only overwrite files if force is active
3. Write a simple test script that can be run to perform validation based on the Success Criteria and Validation Plan

## Validation Plan
* Think carefully to ensure testing doesn't inadvertently overwrite files in the repo, perform testing in a test folder
- Perform each of the success criteria one at a time and confirm it works as described
* Run the test script and ensure it properly tests the validation plan and has a clean easy to understand output with clear test cases with pass/fail

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] Command output or logs demonstrating completion: All tests pass successfully in the test script
- [x] Path to created/modified files: 
  - Modified agentic-bootstrap.sh to add --force flag and idempotent file creation
  - Created test_bootstrap.sh to validate the changes
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with guidance on directory usage
  - Added documentation for the test script in docs/components/
- [x] Summary of changes made:
  1. Added --force flag to the bootstrap script
  2. Added a helper function to check if files exist before creating
  3. Modified file creation to skip existing files unless forced
  4. Created a comprehensive test script that verifies all success criteria
  5. Updated help messages to document the new --force option
  6. Fixed test script to use local directories instead of system temp directories
  7. Added --no-cleanup option to test script for debugging
  8. Updated AI guidelines to prohibit using directories outside the project

## Notes
The implementation uses a temp file approach for heredocs to avoid complex variable substitution issues.

## Progress Updates
2025-04-08: Started working on the task. Planning to implement idempotent behavior and add a --force flag.
2025-04-08: Completed the task with implementation of --force flag, idempotent file creation logic, and test script.
2025-04-08: Updated implementation to address issue with test script using system temp directories instead of local project directories.
