# Task: GitHub Issues MCP Integration

**Status**: backlog

## Objective
Extend the AI Bootstrap GitHub integration to support GitHub Issues operations via MCP, enabling AI agents to create, update, and track issues as part of the workflow.

## Context
Following the implementation of GitHub MCP integration for PR workflows, this task aims to further enhance the GitHub integration by adding support for GitHub Issues operations. This would enable a complete GitHub workflow from issue creation to PR submission.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Documentation updated with GitHub Issues MCP operations
- [ ] AI workflow extended to include issue creation and management
- [ ] Bootstrap script enhanced to support GitHub Issues integration
- [ ] Test task created to validate GitHub Issues integration
- [ ] Validation tests passed showing successful GitHub Issues operations

## Dependencies
- GitHub MCP Integration Implementation task

## Implementation Plan
1. Update GitHub MCP operations guide:
   - Extend `/docs/agentic/github-mcp-guide.md` with GitHub Issues command formats
   - Include command templates for creating issues, updating issues, and adding comments

2. Update AI agent instructions:
   - Extend GitHub operations section with issue management guidelines
   - Define when and how to create issues for new feature requests or bugs
   - Document how to link PRs to issues using GitHub references

3. Update task metadata format:
   - Add fields for tracking issue numbers and linking to related PRs
   - Update progress updates section to include issue status transitions

4. Enhance bootstrap script:
   - Update `--with-github-mcp` flag to include issues support
   - Add options for customizing issue templates and labels

## Validation Plan
- Test GitHub Issues integration:
  - Verify issue creation with proper formatting
  - Verify issue updates and comments
  - Verify linking between issues and PRs
  - Verify task file updates with issue information

## Evidence of Completion
(To be filled by AI)
- [ ] Command output or logs demonstrating completion
- [ ] Path to created/modified files
- [ ] Summary of changes made

## Notes
This task is currently in the backlog as it depends on the successful implementation of the core GitHub MCP integration. There are potential concerns about scope and model capacity to handle complex GitHub workflows that should be evaluated after the initial GitHub integration is complete.
