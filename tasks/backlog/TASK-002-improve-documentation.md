# Task: Improve Workflow Documentation [TASK-002]

> **Status**: backlog | **Priority**: high | **Assigned**: ai-agent | **Tags**: documentation, workflow

## Objective
Improve the documentation of the AI agent workflow to make it easier for both humans and AI agents to understand and follow.

## Context
The AI Bootstrap project provides a structured workflow for AI agent tasks, but the documentation needs to be filled out to make the workflow more usable. This task focuses on improving the documentation to make the repository itself follow the workflow it defines.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Document the architecture of the workflow in architecture.md
- [ ] Create component documentation for the bootstrap script
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with specific guidelines for this repository
- [ ] Create a task that demonstrates the workflow

## Dependencies
None

## Implementation Plan
1. Review the current documentation and bootstrap script to understand the workflow
2. Flesh out architecture.md to describe the workflow system
3. Create component documentation for the bootstrap script
4. Update CLAUDE.md to provide specific guidelines for this repository
5. Create a sample task that follows the workflow

## Validation Plan
- Verify that all documentation is consistent and follows markdown best practices
- Check that the documentation accurately reflects the actual repository structure
- Ensure that the workflow is clearly explained and easy to follow

## Evidence of Completion
(To be filled by AI)
- [ ] Completed architecture.md document
- [ ] New component documentation for the bootstrap script
- [ ] Updated CLAUDE.md file
- [ ] This task file moved to the completed directory

## Notes
This task is about making the repository "eat its own dog food" by using its defined workflow to manage itself.

## Progress Updates
(To be filled by AI during implementation)
