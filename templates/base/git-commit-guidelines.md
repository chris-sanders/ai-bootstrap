## Git Commit Guidelines

When committing changes:

1. Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of changes
2. Never include AI attribution in commit messages (no "Created by Claude" or similar)
3. Follow the project's commit message format
4. Include only relevant files in your commits
5. Make atomic commits that address a single concern
