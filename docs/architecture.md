# System Architecture

This document describes the overall system architecture of the AI Bootstrap workflow.

## Overview
The AI Bootstrap project defines a minimalist but functional workflow for managing AI agent tasks within software projects. It provides a standardized directory structure, documentation templates, and process guidelines to make AI agent contributions more effective and easier to manage.

## Components

### Directory Structure
- `/docs/agentic/`: Contains configuration and instructions for AI agents
  - `templates/`: Reusable templates for tasks and documentation
  - `ai-readme.md`: Instructions for AI agents on how to work within the project
- `tasks/`: Contains task descriptions organized by status
  - `backlog/`: Tasks identified but not yet ready for implementation
  - `ready/`: Tasks that are ready to be worked on
  - `started/`: Tasks currently in progress
  - `completed/`: Tasks that have been completed
- `docs/`: Project documentation
  - `components/`: Documentation for individual components
  - `decisions/`: Record of architectural decisions
  - `architecture.md`: This document

### Bootstrap Script
The `agentic-bootstrap.sh` script initializes the directory structure and creates template files in a target project. It is designed to be run once to set up the workflow.

### Workflow Process
The workflow follows a simple task lifecycle:
1. Tasks are created and placed in the backlog
2. Tasks are moved to ready when they are well-defined and ready to be worked on
3. AI agents pick up tasks from ready, move them to started, and update their status
4. When complete, tasks are moved to the completed directory with evidence of completion

## Data Flow
1. Humans create tasks and place them in the appropriate directory
2. AI agents read tasks from the ready directory
3. AI agents update task status and provide progress notes
4. AI agents move completed tasks to the completed directory
5. All participants maintain documentation to reflect the current state of the project

## Deployment Model
This workflow is designed to be embedded within any software project. The bootstrap script sets up the necessary structure without modifying the existing project organization.

## Technologies
- Bash (bootstrap script)
- Markdown (documentation and task definitions)
- Git (version control)
